# Our custom C library

This is our super basic library. It has one function that takes two numbers and sums them together. The project is broken down in the following way:

- *david_sum.c*: The function that will do the processing
- *david_sum.h*: The header file
- *main.c*: An example that uses the function to show that the library works in C

To compile the library and the main app, you just have to type in the console `make`. Then, if you list the content of the folder, you'll see the library with the main app, called `the_app` (so original ðŸ˜…). If you run this, it will output in the terminal the result of the addition. Proving that everything works.

`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./the_app`

Once this part is done, you don't have to move the compiled library from this directory, because it's going to be linked in the `binding.gyp` file directly to here.
